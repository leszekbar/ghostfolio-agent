# Dependency Rule

Never add dependencies (e.g. in `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`) unless there is existing code in the codebase that imports or uses them.

- Before adding a dependency, verify at least one file uses it.
- If adding new code that introduces a dependency, add both the code and the dependency together.
- Do not add "likely future" dependencies speculatively.
